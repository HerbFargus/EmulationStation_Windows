system: 
ScummVM

extensions: 
scummvm

core(s):
scummvm_libretro.dll

in order to launch these games you'll need to create a .scummvm file for each game based on their short name per this page https://scummvm.org/compatibility, 
otherwise you can launch the core directly through retroarch and navigate the scummvm gui from there, alternatively you can manually install the standalone scummvm

eg
File: Pajama Sam 1: No Need to Hide When It's Dark Outside.scummvm
