Pegasus Frontend: 

Open pegasus-fe.bat 

The reason we use a .bat file is it allows pegasus to run from a USB or 
portable hard drive and isn't required to be installed on the computer.
This build will only look for preset paths from the portable launch, otherwise
it won't find any of your assets if you just launch the executable.

Games:

Add your games and ROMS to the /games/[CONSOLE] folder

Bios:

Add the required BIOS files to /systems/retroarch/system

Pre-Requisites:

For video/audio playback in Pegasus you may need to install some extra codecs.
Use the K-Lite Codec Pack (basic version should be fine):

Scraping:

Skraper is a good tool for scraping assets for your games:

Skraper Conversion:

Since Skraper doesn't quite yet have a profile for Pegasus, you can use this tool
to convert the .dat files to .xml files compatible with pegasus:
